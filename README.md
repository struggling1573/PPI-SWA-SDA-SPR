# PPI-SWA-SDA-SPR

There are the scripts for haploid genome anslysis of three snow trouts: *Schizothorax davidi*, *S. prenanti* and *S. wangchiachii* and *Percocypris pingi*  

## Description for each directory:
- The [Genome survey](https://github.com/struggling1573/PPI-SWA-SDA-SPR/tree/main/Genome%20survey) directory contains codes for genome size, heterozygosity and ploidy assessment.

- The [Assembly](https://github.com/struggling1573/PPI-SWA-SDA-SPR/tree/main/Assembly) directory contains codes for trio binning, haploid genome assembly. The results of genomic assessments are also in the directory.

- The [Annotation](https://github.com/struggling1573/PPI-SWA-SDA-SPR/tree/main/Annotation) directory contains codes for repeat, gene set and gene function annotations.

- The [Sequence similarity](https://github.com/struggling1573/PPI-SWA-SDA-SPR/tree/main/Sequence%20similarity) directory contains codes for the analysis of sequence similarity between different haploid genome.

- The [Phased_block](https://github.com/struggling1573/PPI-SWA-SDA-SPR/tree/main/Phased_block) direcotory contains codes for haplotype reconstruction analysis of each chromosome linkage block.

- The [Phylogenomics](https://github.com/struggling1573/PPI-SWA-SDA-SPR/tree/main/Phylogenomics) directory contains codes for the construction of phylogenetic trees using single-copy orthologies between species, computation of ultrametric tree, analysis of haplotype ancestral gene loss.

- The [Sex chromosome](https://github.com/struggling1573/PPI-SWA-SDA-SPR/tree/main/Sex%20chromosome) directory contains codes for the reads depth and GWAS (Genome-wide association studies) analysis of male and female populations.

- The [RNA-seq analysis](https://github.com/struggling1573/PPI-SWA-SDA-SPR/tree/main/RNA-seq%20analysis) directory contains codes for the analysis of chromosome loss caused by hybridization events, and gene expression in gonad tissue.
