There are the scripts for haplotype genome anslysis of three snow trouts and Percocypris pingi  


- The Genome survey directory contains codes for genome size, heterozygosity and ploidy assessment.

- The Assembly directory contains codes for trio binning, haploid genome assembly. The results of genomic assessments are also in the directory.

- The Annotation directory contains codes for repeat, gene set and gene function annotations.

- The Sequence similarity directory contains codes for the analysis of sequence similarity between different haploid genome.

- The Phased_block direcotory contains codes for haplotype reconstruction analysis of each chromosome linkage block.

- The Phylogenomics directory contains codes for the construction of phylogenetic trees using single-copy orthologies between species, computation of ultrametric tree, analysis of haplotype ancestral gene loss.

- The Sex chromosome directory contains codes for the reads depth and GWAS (Genome-wide association studies) analysis of male and female populations.

- The Sex chromosome directory contains codes for the analysis of chromosome loss caused by hybridization events, and gene expression in gonad tissue.
